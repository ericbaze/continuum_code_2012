							<p><b>Continuum Analytics, leaders in scientific computing with Python, specialize in solving large data set problems in technical computing with a specific focus on data management, analysis, and visualization.</b>  Our developers are highly trained in various scientific specialties with advanced degrees from leading institutions throughout the world.  In addition, they have many years working on challenging projects in Energy, Finance, Defense, Biomedical, and other scientific domains.</p>
							<p>With this unique combination of scientific knowledge and programming expertise, we can provide clients with innovative, effective solutions for even the most challenging of problems.  We apply our deep technical expertise both creatively and pragmatically, drawing upon wisdom and perspective gained from years and years of solving real problems for real customers.</p>
							<p>We prefer an iterative development model in which our clients are an active part of the development process.  Clients are able to work with the product as it is prototyped and refined, and provide regular feedback throughout the engagement.  Additionally, when we face decisions about key trade-offs (as is often the case when solving hard problems), customers are able to provide much more meaningful input because they have been actively engaged throughout the development process.  Iterated development best ensures overall customer satisfaction.</p>
							<p>In order to ensure successful adoption, we provide integration, product training and support services for each software package we produce.</p>
							<p>Our areas of expertise include:
								<ul>
                                	<li>data management for analysis</li>
