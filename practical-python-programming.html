                                    <p>The course is taught over three days and covers the Python language and critical library modules for writing useful programs (testing, files, file system, subprocesses, databases, and systems integration).
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><b>Introduction to Python.</b> An introduction to the Python programming language. Covers details of how to start and stop the interpreter and write programs. Introduces Python's basic datatypes, files, functions, and error handling.<br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Working with Data.</b> A detailed tour of how to represent and work with data in Python. Covers tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets. Students will also learn how to effectively use Python's very powerful list processing primitives such as list comprehensions. Finally, this section covers critical aspects of Python's underlying object model including variables, reference counting, copying, and type checking.<br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Program Organization and Functions.</b> More information about how to organize larger programs into functions. A major focus of this section is on how to design functions that are reliable and can be easily reused in other settings. Also covers technical details of functions including scoping rules and documentation strings.<br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Modules and Libraries.</b> How to organize programs into modules and details on using modules as a tool for creating extensible programs. Concludes with a tour of some of the most commonly used library modules including those related to system administration, text processing, subprocesses, XML parsing, binary data handling, and databases.<br/><br/><em>Note: In addition, an optional section on using numpy and matplotlib to process numeric data can be taught depending on student interest.</em><br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Classes and Objects.</b> An introduction to object-oriented programming in Python. Describes how to create new objects, overload operators, and utilize Python special methods. Also covers basic principles of object oriented programming including inheritance and composition.<br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Inside the Python Object System.</b> A detailed look at how objects are implemented in Python. Major topics include object representation, attribute binding, inheritance, memory management, and special properties of classes including properties, slots, and private attributes.<br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Testing, Debugging, and Software Development Practice.</b> This section discusses many issues that are considered important to Python software development. This includes effective use of documentation strings, program testing using both the doctest and unittest modules, and effective use of assertions. The Python debugger and profiler are also described.<br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Iterators and Generators</b>. Covers the iteration protocol, iterable objects, generators and generator expressions. A major focus of this section concerns the use of generators to set up data processing pipelines - a particularly effective technique for addressing a wide variety of common systems programming problems (e.g., processing large datafiles, handling infinite data streams, etc.).<br/><br/></li>
        
                                        <li><b>Text I/O Handling. (Optional)</b> More information on text-based I/O. Topics include text generation, template strings, and Unicode.<br/><br/></li>

                                	    <p>The class is best suited for 10-15 students. A larger class size is possible, but should not exceed 25 students.</p>
                            			<p>For on-site courses, clients provide the instruction space, a video projector, and machines where students can work on the programming exercises. The course can be taught on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS-X. However, all machines must be equipped with the latest version of Python (currently Python 2.7).</p>
										<p>Although the class notes are extensive, all attendees are encouraged to bring a Python book for reference. Absolute beginners may want to consider a book such as "Learning Python" or "Dive Into Python." If you already have some Python experience, consider a book such as the "Python Essential Reference" or "Python in a Nutshell."</p>
