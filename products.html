										<p>Anaconda Pro is the Python distribution for Scientific, Engineering, and Business Intelligence Data Management. It includes all the numerical and scientific libraries that scientists, engineers, and data analysts need to do their work, with a single integrated and flexible installer. Like Anaconda CE, Anaconda Pro includes Disco (on Linux) for fast, easy-to-use Map Reduce from within Python, and also provides other distributed computing tools like MPI and IPython Parallel.</p>
										<p>Anaconda Pro also comes bundled with IOPro and Numba Pro as well as algorithms from wise.io making it a complete package for efficient, high-performance, large data analysis with Python.</p>
                                        <p>**<em>Anaconda Pro includes IOPro and Numba Pro packages.</em></p>

                                    	<p>Wrangling different sources of data has always been a major pain point for scientists, engineers, and technology professionals. IOPro is a fast, flexible, and efficient tool for importing data from many different data sources directly into one or more NumPy arrays. Its interface is easy to configure, and has many options for processing text files and relational databases. Additionally, IOPro can load data on demand, so large data sets which would otherwise exhaust available memory can be easily brought into Python. IOPro has smart inferencing of data types, but is flexible enough to allow for a wide variety of custom importing of delimited and columnar data.</p>

                                   	   <h4>Array-oriented Python Compiler for NumPy</h4>
                                    	<p><br/>
                                   	    NumPy is the fundamental array-object of choice for scientists and engineers. It has introduced array-oriented programming techniques to a wide variety of Python programmers. Scientists and engineers are now accustomed to using NumPy's fast and efficient vectorized operations for processing and transforming their data.</p>
										<p>Numba Pro allows scientists and engineers to augment NumPy's fast vectorized operations with their own custom Python functions. These functions are compiled (either at run time or build time) from Python expressions to blazing fast native code. Array-oriented programming has always been very fast but sometimes difficult to achieve. With built-in NumPy routines, Numba Pro makes it possible to extend NumPy with compiled Python code.</p>
