                            <p><b>Geared toward quantitative analysts and technology staff, Python for Quants and Engineers provides a strong foundation which will enable you to work and prototype much more rapidly.</b></p>
							<p><b>Overview</b><br/>The course includes an abbreviated primer on the Python language including (syntax and data structures, basic data processing, and Python functions, modules and classes). The remainder of the course covers open source tools relevant to day-to-day financial problem solving. Items covered include: array computation and mathematics with NumPy, and statistical computation with SciPy; working with tabular data in Pandas to generate summary statistics and rolling window calculations; and using libraries for numerical optimization.</p>
							<p>To interface with the rest of your libraries, we teach ways of wrapping C/C++ code in Python, along with ways to compile Python to C for dramatically improved performance. We'll cover how to call Python functions from Excel, as well as how to manipulate Excel spreadsheets and documents from Python. In addition, we'll cover methods of exposing your Python code over the web.</p>

                                    <p>The course is taught over four days and covers the Python language and critical library modules for finance and engineering, including data visualization.</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><b>Introduction to Python.</b> An introduction to the Python programming language. Covers details of how to start and stop the interpreter and write programs. Introduces Python's basic datatypes, files, functions, and error handling.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Working with Data.</b> A detailed tour of how to represent and work with data in Python. Covers tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets. Students will also learn how to effectively use Python's very powerful list processing primitives such as list comprehensions. Finally, this section covers critical aspects of Python's underlying object model including variables, reference counting, copying, and type checking.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Program Organization and Functions.</b> More information about how to organize larger programs into functions. A major focus of this section is on how to design functions that are reliable and can be easily reused in other settings. Also covers technical details of functions including scoping rules and documentation strings.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Modules and Libraries.</b> How to organize programs into modules and details on using modules as a tool for creating extensible programs. Concludes with a tour of some of the most commonly used library modules including those related to system administration, text processing, subprocesses, XML parsing, binary data handling, and databases.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Classes and Objects.</b> An introduction to object-oriented programming in Python. Describes how to create new objects, overload operators, and utilize Python special methods. Also covers basic principles of object oriented programming including inheritance and composition.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>NumPy.</b>  NumPy is Python's array and mathematics library.  Covers how one can and should use NumPy to simplify and speed up your code.  Starts with a brief overview of NumPys memory model.  Also teaches ways to slice and dice data using NumPys sophisticated indexing operations.  Covers mathematical use cases, various interpolation functions, matrix decompositions, computing eigenvalues, solving systems of equations and inverting matrices.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>SciPy.</b>  SciPy is Python's scientific complement to NumPy.  SciPy is quite broad,  as it is used in many different domains.  We cover some key areas that are relevant to finance.  We start with SciPy's statistical functions, how to generate different distributions and perform statistical computations.  We also cover some signal processing and fourier transforms, as the are useful in efficiently computing some moving window fuctions (moving averages, exponential moving averages, bollinger bands)</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Pandas.</b>  Pandas is Python's answer to the R dataframe.  Pandas provides a very convenient way to work with tabular data.  It helps you organize your data by handling missing data, and data alignment for you automatically.  Pandas also gives you the ability to do simple olap aggregations and dirll downs without any additional code.  It also has efficient computations for statistical functions, including moving window fucntions and rolling regressions.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Integrating with Native Code.</b>  Python is fantastic, but often we have to work with code in pre-existing C/C++ libraries.  One of the easies ways to do this is with Python's built in ctypes libraries.  However, with a bit more investment you can get much more Pythonic interfaces using Cython - a Python to C compiler.  In addition, Cython can be used to speed up Python code dramatically.  We will show you several use cases, so you can write Python code first, and then optimize for speed later.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Production Python in Finance.</b>  Python is fantastic for data analysis, but one of it's key features is that it allows you to go from quantitative analysis to a production application extremely rapidly.  You can wrap Python analysis code up in a web application for effortless deployment.  Or we can expose Python to excel so you can use your Python code in your worksheets.  We can also show you how to script excel using Python.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Numerical Optimization.</b>  One of the key reasons that quants love Matlab, is that it makes it very easy to solve numerical optimisation problems.  We cover the main optimisation libraries so you know what's out there, as well as teach you how to use them to solve real world problems.</li><br/><br/>
                                            <li><b>Data Visualization.</b>  Matplotlib is a Python visualisation library which makes it easy to generate static plots.  We'll show you how to use it to create all the plots you'll ever need.  We'll cover basic line plots, scatter plots, density estimation plots as well as date handling.  If you have any specific plotting requirements, let us know and we can cover those use cases as well.</li>
