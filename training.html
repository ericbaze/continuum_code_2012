                            <p><b>Continuum Analytics, in partnership with <a href="www.dabeaz.com" title="Dabeaz LLC" target="_blank">Dabeaz LLC</a>, delivers the following programming courses at your place of business.</b> Public courses open for individual enrollments are offered on an ongoing basis in Chicago, IL.  
                            <ul>
                            	<li><b><a href="practical-python-programming.html" title="Practical Python Programming">Practical Python Programming</a></b><br/>A 3-day class on the Python programming language and standard library with a focus on applying Python to problems in scripting, data analysis, and systems programming. This course assumes no prior experience with Python, but assumes that participants already know how to program in another programming language. It is especially well-suited for programmers who want to know what Python is all about without extra fluff.<br/><br/></li>
                                <li><b><a href="python-for-quants.html" title="Python for Quants &amp; Engineers">Python for Quants and Engineers</a></b><br/>Geared toward quantitative analysts and technology staff, Python for Quants and Engineers provides a strong foundation which will enable you to work and prototype much more rapidly.<br/><br/>
								The course includes an abbreviated primer on the Python language including (syntax and data structures, basic data processing, and Python functions, modules and classes).  The remainder of the course covers open source tools relevant to day-to-day financial problem solving.  Items covered include: array computation and mathematics with NumPy, and statistical computation with SciPy;  working with tabular data in Pandas to generate summary statistics and rolling window calculations;  and using libraries for numerical optimization.<br/><br/>
								To interface with the rest of your libraries, we teach ways of wrapping C/C++ code in Python, along with ways to compile Python to C for dramatically improved performance.  We'll cover how to call Python functions from Excel, as well as how to manipulate Excel spreadsheets and documents from Python.  In addition, we'll cover methods of exposing your Python code over the web.<br/><br/></li>

                            <h4>About the Practical Python Programming Course</h4>
							<p>This course has been developed by David Beazley, a 15-year Python programming veteran, elected member of the <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/" title="Python Software Foundation" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a>, frequent <a href="https://us.pycon.org/" title="PyCON" target="_blank">PyCON</a> presenter, and author of the well-respected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-M.-Beazley/e/B001ILMCAQ/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1" title="Python Essential Reference" target="_blank">"Python Essential Reference".</a> What to expect if you take a course:
						  <ul>
                                	<li><b>Real-world focus.</b> The primary focus is on practical applications and common programming problems faced by actual Python programmers. You'll learn how to crunch data, interact with the operating system, organize programs, integrate Python with other software, write tests, and more.<br/><br/></li>
                                	<li><b>Attention to detail.</b> Thousands of man-hours have gone into developing the presentation materials and exercises. Course notes include hundreds of pages of fully indexed reference material, figures, and code examples. Exercises provide the essential building blocks for writing larger Python programs after you're done with the class.<br/><br/></li>
                                	<li><b>Hands-on.</b> In these classes, more than half of the time is spent writing programs. You're going to get your hands dirty writing useful programs.<br/><br/></li>
                                	<li><b>No marketing jargon or buzzwords.</b> Concepts are clearly explained using plain language and examples are designed to be understood by anyone who has had some prior programming experience. It is not necessary to be a professional computer scientist, software engineer, or an expert in specific software development methodologies (i.e., object-oriented programming).<br/><br/></li>
                                	<li><b>No advocacy.</b> Classes are solely focused on using Python--not convincing you to use Python in the first place. They also do not advocate any particular method of programming or software development. There is more than one way to do it as well as tradeoffs.<br/><br/></li>
                                	<li><b>No regurgitation.</b> These classes are wholly original works that are strongly focused on core concepts and building an understanding of why you use various Python features and why Python works in the way that it does.<br/><br/></li>
                                	<li><b>A brisk pace.</b> Your time is valuable. These courses present information in a way that is highly organized and which prefers hands-on programming over drawn-out talking. Classes are organized around short lecture segments (10-20 minutes) followed by coding exercises (20-30 minutes). You won't be bored.</li>
