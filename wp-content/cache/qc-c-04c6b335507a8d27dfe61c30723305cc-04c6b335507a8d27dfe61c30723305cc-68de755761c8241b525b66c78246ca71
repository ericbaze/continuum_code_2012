			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Continuum’s revolution to change how the world analyzes data begins with the release<br/> of Anaconda.</strong></p>
<p>Austin, Texas &#8211; Continuum Analytics, Inc. is proud to announce Anaconda, a scalable distributed data analysis runtime for Python.  Anaconda gives analysts and data scientists a tested and supported platform for their computational needs by combining the familiar and popular tools available in Python with additional tools for parallel and distributed computation, including MapReduce, interactive parallelism, and MPI.  </p>
<p>“We are looking to help people take advantage of the power and flexibility of Python, Numpy, SciPy and related tools, but on a much larger scale”, said Travis Oliphant, CEO.</p>
<p>Peter Wang, President of Continuum, said, “We recognized the increasing popularity of Python and its scientific stack as a data analysis tool, and built Anaconda to provide a tested, supported platform for anyone processing large data sets.”</p>
<p>The current release, a public beta version of Anaconda Community Edition, is compatible with the most popular flavors of Linux, as well as VMware and Amazon’s EC2 compute cloud.  Anaconda 1.0, available later this summer, will be offered as both Community and Professional Editions, with the latter offering enterprise support and additional features.</p>
<p>Continuum Analytics provides software tools, training, and integration/consulting services to corporate, government, and educational clients worldwide.  Areas of expertise include geophysics, finance, business and marketing analytics, and the emerging field of data science. </p>
<p>To download Anaconda or for more information, visit <a href="http://continuum.io/anaconda" title="Download Anaconda">http://continuum.io/anaconda</a>.</p>
